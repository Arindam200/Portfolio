## Introduction

Python is one of the easiest programming languages, and it can be used in almost every technical field ‚Äî whether it's data science, automation, IoT, AI, machine learning, or web development. And the most interesting part of Python is that it‚Äôs **100% open-source**, which makes it even more powerful and dynamic.

Yet, Most developers overlook Python when building their web applications which limits its potential.

In this article, I've covered 11 open-source Python projects that every web developer should keep an eye on.¬†

As a pure Python developer or a backend developer with no knowledge of frontend development, I know the pain of not having a way to showcase your project because it‚Äôs usually all code and has no user interface. If this is you, this tool is a game changer.¬†

With reflex, you can build interactive user interfaces in the simplest way using pure Python so quickly and easily; how cool is that!¬†¬†

![GIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/hS4Dz87diTpnDXf98E/giphy.gif?cid=790b76111hxaa79zzy52qyxpdt5jb52z3z3giu3t80xsllrx&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

This reduces the need to learn the newest, shiny frontend framework; it handles user interface and server logic.¬†

This tool works by building components from pure Python, compared to traditional web development, where a full-stack application has two separate apps: one that handles the user interface and the other that handles the server logic or state management. This could be React for the user interface and Flask for the server logic. In Reflex, everything is built in one codebase and could be stored in one project file.

In addition, you won‚Äôt need to learn how to deploy on Heroku, AWS, or Azure. Reflex offers an easy way to deploy your project with a single command.
